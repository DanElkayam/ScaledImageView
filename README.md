ScaleImageView
============================

A fork for the original project:
https://github.com/davemorrissey/subsampling-scale-image-view

This view is quite the same as the original (abilities & restrictions): allows you to load high resolation
images asynchronously, zooming in and out, and scroll the content of it without demaging the image resolution.

This fork presents different approch about implementing the user's gestures detection code.
